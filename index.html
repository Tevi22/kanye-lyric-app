Oh, baby (hahaha)
Turn the motherfuckin' music up

When it comes to being true
At least true to me (that's right, it's what I do, c'mon)
One thing I've found (uh-huh)
One thing I've found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down (no, I ain't never let you down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get down

First I snatched the streets
Then I snatch the charts
First I had they ear
Now I have they hear
Rappers came and went
I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together
Watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen 'em re-po'd, re-sold, and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one positions
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines are sizzlin'
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life, this is not an image
This is God-given
This is hard livin' mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits
You could fit inside a whole disk and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position
Holla at ya boy
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get

I get down for my grandfather
Who took my mama, made her sit in that seat
Where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of six she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
Swear, I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racisim's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and when to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I been baptised 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise you, cons are gettin' paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than Do-Rags to get you waves
Nothin' as sad as the day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you was smilin' when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what a accident did to Left-Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watchin' me from the other side

When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I've found
Oh, no, you'll never let me down
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle
I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryin' to give us, "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop
That's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down

If I were on the highest cliff on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clenched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever, let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship
Has been signed in the language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color, and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God rains out

Take 'em to church
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I've found
Ohm no, you'll never let me down
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get
Get up I get
Get up I get
Get up I get
Get up I get down

who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh, yeah, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing, but he got this strong (the Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
Let you tell that man I'm falling
Well, somebody must've caught him, 'cause
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the Eighth Wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, dissin' Jay
Dissin' Jay will get you mased

When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, "Please Father forgive us"
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive
Down, down, down, down, down
